             that do not fit into well-defined categories such as boilers, turbines or process heaters. \
             These units are called **Other Combustion Source (OCS)**. Units that fall into this category are \
             commercial gas-fired water heaters, kitchen equipment, among others. The OCS term helps simplify \
             the emissions reporting process for equipment that falls in that group. Boilers and water heaters supply \
              hot water or steam for space heating of university buildings and for use in laboratories. \
             Furnaces are employed to heat air distributed through ducts for heating large spaces and in \

    The exploratory data analysis looked to identify the major drivers and patterns of combustion energy use \
             across U.S. industrial facilities in 2014. The dataset used, which contained over 18,000 \
             combustion units (after the data cleaning process), belonging to different industrial facilities \
             across the U.S., provided several key insights.

    Petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants are the facilities that consume the most combustion energy \
             and also have a significant number of combustion units. By extension, ExxonMobil and the Marathon \
             Petroleum Company are the two major contributors to combustion energy consumption in the U.S. \
             in 2014. This situation is due to their ownership of several massive petroleum and petrochemical facilities \
             across the country, particularly in the southern region. Additionally, a breakdown of the facilities \
             with the highest number of combustion units revealed that educational institutions are significant \
             users of combustion energy, using these units for research and other campus activities.

    A significant number of outliers were also present in the combustion energy use data. This finding \

    - Governmental agencies at the federal and state levels should consider creating energy \

             This exercise would further improve the current energy efficiency programs of these \
             industries.
    - Further analysis should focus on the outliers identified in the dataset to determine the \
             underlying causes of such high combustion energy values. 
    - Facilities with high combustion energy use rates but limited or no cogeneration units should \
             be ideal targets for cogeneration modification campaigns and be given incentives for \
             complying.
    - Data on the age and efficiency rating of the combustion units should be collected to aid \
             efficient industrial policy recommendations, through the analysis of the underlying \
             technology and its service life on energy efficiency.
